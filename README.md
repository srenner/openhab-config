# openhab-config
This repository contains some configuration and scripts for my [openHAB](http://www.openhab.org/) installation, excluding files that contain private data (webcam passwords, etc.).

I am using openHAB 1.x running on Ubuntu Server 14.04 with an Aeon Labs DSA02203-ZWUS Z-Wave Z-Stick Series 2 USB Dongle.
